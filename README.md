Documentation of [AniList.co](http://anilist.co/) JSON API

For any questions, feature requests or issues with our API, or API documentation please use our [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/Josh-Star/AniList-API-Docs/issues), not the AniList forums.

## API development state
The AniList API is currently in a "development state",
this means we will be making backwards compatible breaking changes to the API, with little to no notice.
This is so we can quickly fix any bugs, issues or inconsistencies with the API
without supporting a short-lived and underused API version.

As there are very few active clients released at the moment I doubt this will cause many issue at all,
 but we'll try to get passed this phase as soon as we can anyway.
